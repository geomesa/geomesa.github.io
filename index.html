            <p class="lead">GeoMesa is an open-source, distributed, spatio-temporal database built on top of the Apache Accumulo column family store.  Leveraging a highly parallelized indexing strategy, GeoMesa aims to provide as much of the spatial querying and data manipulation to Accumulo as PostGIS does to Postgres.</p>

            <h2>Quick start</h2>
            <p>Navigate to where you would like to download the project and run:</p>
            <p><code>git clone git@github.com:locationtech/geomesa.git</code></p>

            <p>GeoMesa is managed by <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>, and is built with the command:</p> 
            <p><code>mvn clean install</code></p>
            <p>From the root directory, this builds each sub-project with its additional dependencies-included JAR.</p>

            <h2>Roadmap</h2>
            <p>GeoMesa aims for a 1.0 release in September.  Features that remain to be implemented include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>deep integration with Accumulo and Geoserver security</li>
                <li>query-planning optimizations</li>
                <li>optimization of storage and querying of lines and polygons</li>
            </ul>
            <a name="downloads"></a>
            <h2>Downloads</h2>
            <p>GeoMesa artifacts including client API jars and deployable Accumulo extensions will be in Maven Central.  For now, users should build the project locally using Maven.</p>
