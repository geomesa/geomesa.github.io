### Background

#### Visibilities and Authorizations

One of the most powerful features of Accumulo is the implementation of cell-level security, using
```visibilities``` and ```authorizations```. Data that is protected by visibilities can only be seen
by users that have the corresponding authorizations. This allows for the fine-grained protection of
data, based on arbitrary labels.

*Note: authorizations are distinct from table-level permissions, and operate at a much finer grain.*

If you are not familiar with Accumulo authorizations, you should review the relevant Accumulo
[documentation](http://accumulo.apache.org/1.5/accumulo_user_manual.html#_security), with more
examples [here](http://accumulo.apache.org/1.5/examples/visibility.html).

#### PKI

Public key infrastructure can be used to securely authenticate end users. In PKI, a ```certificate
authority``` (CA) will issue digital certificates that verify that a particular public key belongs to a
particular individual. Other users can then trust that certificate because it has been digitally
signed by the CA.

In this tutorial, the keys used are not provided by trusted CAs. As such, it is necessary to import
the CA's certificate into the Java keystore, which allows Java (and by extension Tomcat) to trust
any keys verified by the CA.

PKI solves the issue of ```authentication``` (*who* a user is) but not ```authorization``` (*what* a
user can do). For this tutorial, authorization is provided by an LDAP server.

### This tutorial will show you how to:

1.  Set visibilities on your data during ingestion through GeoMesa
2.  Apply authorizations to your queries through GeoMesa
3.  Implement user authorizations through the GeoMesa GeoServer plugin, using PKI certs to
authenticate with GeoServer and LDAP to store authorizations
4.  Query GeoServer over WFS using a Java client using PKI certs for authentication

<div class="callout callout-warning">
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></span>
    You will need access to a Hadoop 2.2 installation as well as an Accumulo 1.5.x database.
</div>

#### Other prerequisites

Before you begin, you should also have these:

* a locally-built version of GeoMesa - see [GeoMesa Quickstart](/2014/05/28/geomesa-quickstart/) - (DOWNLOAD AND BUILD GEOMESA)
* an Accumulo user that has appropriate permissions to query your data
* a local copy of the Java Development Kit 1.7.x
* Apache Maven installed
* a GitHub client installed

### GeoMesa Implementation Details - Visibilities

Currently GeoMesa supports applying a single set of visibilities to all data in a DataStore. When
configuring a DataStore, the visibilities can be set with the ```visibilities``` parameter:

{% highlight java %}
// create a map containing initialization data for the GeoMesa data store
Map<String, String> configuration = ...
configuration.put("visibilities", "user&admin");
DataStore dataStore = DataStoreFinder.getDataStore(configuration);
{% endhighlight %}

Any data written by this DataStore will have the visibilities 'user&admin' applied.

Future versions of GeoMesa will allow visibilities to be applied at a more granular level.

### GeoMesa Implementation Details - Authorizations

When performing a query, GeoMesa delegates the retrieval of authorizations to ```service providers``` that
implement the following interface:

{% highlight java %}
package geomesa.core.security;

public interface AuthorizationsProvider {

    /**
     * Gets the authorizations for the current context. This may change over time (e.g. in a
     * multi-user environment), so the result should not be cached.
     *
     * @return
     */
    public Authorizations getAuthorizations();

    /**
     * Configures this instance with parameters passed into the DataStoreFinder
     *
     * @param params
     */
    public void configure(Map<String, Serializable> params);
}
{% endhighlight %}

When a GeoMesa DataStore is instantiated, it will scan for available service providers.
Third-party implementations can be enabled by simply placing them in the classpath. See the Oracle
[Javadoc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/imageio/spi/ServiceRegistry.html) for
details on implementing a service provider.

The GeoMesa DataStore will call 'configure' on the AuthorizationsProvider implementation, passing in
the parameter map from the call to 'DataStoreFinder.getDataStore(Map params)'. This allows the
AuthorizationsProvider to configure itself based on the environment.

To ensure that the correct AuthorizationsProvider is used, GeoMesa will throw an exception if multiple
third-party service providers are found on the classpath. In this scenario, the particular service
provider class to use can be specified by the following system property:

{% highlight java %}
geomesa.core.security.AuthorizationsProvider.AUTH_PROVIDER_SYS_PROPERTY = "geomesa.auth.provider.impl";
{% endhighlight %}

For simple scenarios, the set of authorizations to apply to all queries can be specified when creating
the GeoMesa DataStore by using the 'auths' configuration parameter. This will use the
DefaultAuthorizationsProvider implementation provided by GeoMesa.

{% highlight java %}
// create a map containing initialization data for the GeoMesa data store
Map<String, String> configuration = ...
configuration.put("auths", "user,admin");
DataStore dataStore = DataStoreFinder.getDataStore(configuration);
{% endhighlight %}

If there are no AuthorizationsProviders found on the classpath, and the 'auths' parameter is not set, GeoMesa will default to
using the authorizations associated with the Accumulo connection (i.e. the 'user' configuration value).

```Note: this is not a recommended approach for a production system.```

In addition, please note that the authorizations used in any scenario cannot exceed the authorizations of the Accumulo connection.

### Ingest GDELT Data with Visibilities

The rest of this tutorial will use the GDELT data set.

If you have never ingested GDELT data, or you have previously ingested it **without** visibilities, you will need to ingest it again.
Follow the instructions [here](/2014/04/17/geomesa-gdelt-analysis/), with the following changes:

* ensure that you have the latest version of the GDELT tutorial code from github
* when executing the map/reduce job, include the following parameter:

{% highlight bash %}
   -visibilities <visibilities>
{% endhighlight %}

The entire command will be as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
hadoop jar /path/to/geomesa-gdelt-accumulo1.5-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
   geomesa.gdelt.GDELTIngest                       \
   -instanceId <accumulo-instance-id>              \
   -zookeepers <zookeeper-hosts-string>            \
   -user <username> -password <password>           \
   -visibilities <visibilities>           \
   -tableName <table> -featureName <feature>       \
   -ingestFile hdfs:///gdelt/uncompressed/gdelt.tsv
{% endhighlight %}

The visibility string can be anything valid for your Accumulo instance. For the rest of this exercise,
we are going to assume the visibility string is 'user', and the Accumulo table is 'gdelt_auths'. You
can see the visibilities that are currently enabled for your user through the accumulo shell:

{% highlight bash %}
$ accumulo shell -u myuser -p mypassword

Shell - Apache Accumulo Interactive Shell
- 
- version: 1.5.1
- instance name: mycloud
- instance id: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
- 
- type 'help' for a list of available commands
- 
myuser@mycloud> getauths
user,admin
{% endhighlight %}

If your user does not already have authorizations, you can add them through the Accumulo shell with the 'addauths' command:

*Note: A user cannot set authorizations unless the user has the System.ALTER_USER permission*

{% highlight bash %}
myuser@mycloud> getauths
user
myuser@mycloud> addauths -s admin -u myuser
myuser@mycloud> getauths
user,admin
{% endhighlight %}

Once the GDELT data is ingested, you should see a visibility label in square brackets when you scan
the spatio-temporal index table through the Accumulo shell:

{% highlight bash %}
myuser@mycloud> table gdelt_auths_gdelt_st_idx
myuser@mycloud gdelt_auths_gdelt_st_idx> scan
00~gdelt~04e~20080125 169881494:SimpleFeatureAttribute [user]    \x02\x12169881494\x00\xAC\xBE...
{% endhighlight %}

### Download and Build the Tutorial Code

Pick a reasonable directory on your machine, and run:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/geomesa/geomesa-tutorial-authorizations.git
{% endhighlight %}

The ```pom.xml``` file contains an explicit list of dependent libraries that will be bundled together
into the final tutorial. You should confirm that the versions of Accumulo and Hadoop match what you
are running; if it does not match, change the value in the POM. (NB: The only reason these libraries
are bundled into the final JAR is that this is easier for most people to do this than it is to set
the classpath when running the tutorial. If you would rather not bundle these dependencies, mark
them as provided in the POM, and update your classpath as appropriate.)

From within the root of the cloned tutorial, run:

{% highlight bash %}
mvn clean install
{% endhighlight %}

When this is complete, it will have built a JAR file that contains all of the code you need to run the tutorial.

### Run the Tutorial

On the command-line, run:

{% highlight bash %}
java -cp ./target/geomesa-tutorial-authorizations-accumulo1.5-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
   geomesa.tutorial.AuthorizationsTutorial \
   -instanceId <instance> \
   -zookeepers <zoos> \
   -user <user> \
   -password <pwd> \
   -visibilities <visibilities> \
   -tableName <table> \
   -featureName <feature>
{% endhighlight %}

where you provide the following arguments:

* ```<instance>``` - the name of your Accumulo instance
* ```<zoos>``` - comma-separated list of your Zookeeper nodes, e.g. zoo1:2181,zoo2:2181,zoo3:2181
* ```<user>``` - the name of an Accumulo user that will execute the scans, e.g. root
* ```<pwd>``` - the password for the previously-mentioned Accumulo user
* ```<visibilities>``` - the visibilities used to ingest the GDELT dataset, e.g. 'user'
* ```<table>``` - the name of the Accumulo table that has the GeoMesa GDELT dataset, e.g. gdelt_auths
* ```<feature>``` - the feature name used to ingest the GeoMesa GDELT dataset, e.g. gdelt

You should see two queries run and the results printed out to your console. You should see output similar to the following:

{% highlight bash %}
Executing query with AUTHORIZED data store: auths are 'user,admin'
Results:
1|geom=POINT (33.9744 45.2908)

Executing query with UNAUTHORIZED data store: auths are ''
No results
{% endhighlight %}

The first query should return 1 or more results. The second query should return 0 results, since
they are hidden by visibilities.

### Insight Into How the Tutorial Works

The code for querying with authorizations is available in the following class:

* ```geomesa.tutorial.AuthorizationsTutorial```

The interesting code for this tutorial is contained in the 'main' method:

{% highlight java %}
// get an instance of the data store that uses the default authorizations provider, which
// will use whatever auths the connector has available
System.setProperty(AuthorizationsProvider.AUTH_PROVIDER_SYS_PROPERTY,
    DefaultAuthorizationsProvider.class.getName());
DataStore authDataStore = DataStoreFinder.getDataStore(dsConf);

// get another instance of the data store that uses our authorizations provider that
// always returns empty auths
System.setProperty(AuthorizationsProvider.AUTH_PROVIDER_SYS_PROPERTY,
    EmptyAuthorizationsProvider.class.getName());
DataStore noAuthDataStore = DataStoreFinder.getDataStore(dsConf);
{% endhighlight %}

This code snippet shows how you can specify the AuthorizationProvider to use with a system property.
The DefaultAuthorizationsProvider class is provided by GeoMesa, and used when no other implementations are found.
The EmptyAuthorizationsProvider class is included in the tutorial:

{% highlight java %}
geomesa.tutorial.EmptyAuthorizationsProvider
{% endhighlight %}

The EmptyAuthorizationsProvider will always return an empty Authorizations object, which means that
any data stored with visibilities will not be returned.

There is a more useful implementation of AuthorizationsProvider that will be explored in more detail in the next section:

{% highlight java %}
geomesa.tutorial.LdapAuthorizationsProvider
geomesa.tutorial.LdapAuthorizationsProviderTest
{% endhighlight %}

There is a class that shows how to query GeoServer through WFS that will be explored in more detail
later in the tutorial:

{% highlight java %}
geomesa.tutorial.GeoServerAuthorizationsTutorial
{% endhighlight %}

Additionally, there are two helper classes included in the tutorial:

* ```geomesa.tutorial.GdeltFeature``` - Contains the attributes available in the GDELT data set.
* ```geomesa.tutorial.SetupUtil``` - Handles reading command-line arguments

### Applying Authorizations and Visibilities to GeoServer using PKIs and LDAP 

This section will show you how to configure GeoServer to authenticate users with PKIs, use LDAP to
store authorizations, then apply authorizations on a per-user/per-query basis.

Basic user authentication will take place via user-certificates. Each user would have their own public/private
key pair that uniquely identifies them.

User authorizations will come from LDAP. Once a user's identity has been verified via PKI, we will
look up the user's details in LDAP.

Once we have a user's authentication and authorizations, we will apply them to the GeoMesa query using
a custom AuthorizationsProvider implementation.

```Note:``` **It is assumed for the rest of the tutorial that you have created the GeoServer
data stores and layers outlined in the [GDELT tutorial](/2014/04/17/geomesa-gdelt-analysis/)**

#### Run GeoServer in Tomcat

*Note: If you are already running GeoServer in Tomcat, you can skip this step.*

GeoServer ships by default with an embedded Jetty servlet. In order to use PKI login, we need to install it in Tomcat instead.

<!-- we have to use markup here b/c markdown doesn't support nested html in lists - numbers re-start at 1 -->
<ol>
<li>
Download and install <a href='http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi'>Tomcat 7</a>.
</li>

<li>
Create an environment variable pointing to your tomcat installation (you may want to add this to your bash init scripts):
{% highlight bash %}
export CATALINA_HOME=/path/to/tomcat
{% endhighlight %}
</li>

<li>
If you want to re-use your existing GeoServer configuration, create an environment variable pointing to your GeoServer data directory
(you may want to add this to your bash init scripts):
{% highlight bash %}
export GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR=/path/to/geoserver/data_dir
{% endhighlight %}
</li>

<li>
Copy the GeoServer webapp from the GeoServer distribution into the tomcat servlet:

{% highlight bash %}
cp -r /path/to/geoserver/webapps/geoserver/ $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/
{% endhighlight %}
</li>

<li>
Increase the memory allocated to tomcat, which you will need for running complex queries in GeoServer
(the values here may not be applicable for every installation):

{% highlight bash %}
cd $CATALINA_HOME/bin
echo 'CATALINA_OPTS="-Xmx2g -XX:MaxPermSize=128m"' >> setenv.sh
{% endhighlight %}
</li>

<li>
Start tomcat, either as a service or through the start scripts, and ensure that GeoServer is available at <a href='http://localhost:8080/geoserver/web/'>http://localhost:8080/geoserver/web/</a>
</li>

</ol>

#### Create the Accumulo Data Store and Layer in GeoServer

If you haven't already, create an AccumuloDataStore and associated Layer pointing to the data with
visibilities, as described in the [GDELT tutorial](/2014/04/17/geomesa-gdelt-analysis/).

When configuring the DataStore, leave the 'auths' field empty and set the 'visibilities' field to what
you used when ingesting data above.

#### Congfigure GeoServer for PKI Login

Follow the instructions located [here](http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/security/tutorials/cert/index.html)
in order to enable PKI login to GeoServer.

In the step where you add the 'cert' filter to the 'Filter Chains', also add it to the 'rest', 'gwc'
and 'default' chains (in addition to web).

We will be using the 'rod' and 'scott' users, so be sure to install those into your browser..

*Note: There is a bug in the current version of GeoServer (2.5.1) that sometimes does not save
authentication filters properly.*

If, after going through the above steps, you do not get logged in properly, do the following:

<ol>
<li>Shut down GeoServer</li>
<li>Navigate to the GeoServer data directory ($GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR or $GEOSERVER_HOME/data_dir)</li>
<li>Edit the file ./security/config.xml by adding 4 lines:

{% highlight xml %}
<filterChain>
  <filters name="web" class="org.geoserver.security.HtmlLoginFilterChain" interceptorName="interceptor" exceptionTranslationName="exception" path="/web/**,/gwc/rest/web/**,/" disabled="false" allowSessionCreation="true" ssl="false" matchHTTPMethod="false">
    <filter>rememberme</filter>
    <filter>cert</filter> <!--add this line -->
    <filter>form</filter>
    <filter>anonymous</filter>
  </filters>
  ...
  <filters name="rest" class="org.geoserver.security.ServiceLoginFilterChain" interceptorName="restInterceptor" exceptionTranslationName="exception" path="/rest/**" disabled="false" allowSessionCreation="false" ssl="false" matchHTTPMethod="false">
    <filter>cert</filter> <!--add this line -->
    <filter>basic</filter>
    <filter>anonymous</filter>
  </filters>
  <filters name="gwc" class="org.geoserver.security.ServiceLoginFilterChain" interceptorName="restInterceptor" exceptionTranslationName="exception" path="/gwc/rest/**" disabled="false" allowSessionCreation="false" ssl="false" matchHTTPMethod="false">
    <filter>cert</filter> <!--add this line -->
    <filter>basic</filter>
  </filters>
  <filters name="default" class="org.geoserver.security.ServiceLoginFilterChain" interceptorName="interceptor" exceptionTranslationName="exception" path="/**" disabled="false" allowSessionCreation="false" ssl="false" matchHTTPMethod="false">
    <filter>cert</filter> <!--add this line -->
    <filter>basic</filter>
    <filter>anonymous</filter>
  </filters>
</filterChain>
{% endhighlight %}
</li>

<li>Re-start GeoServer</li>
<li>Verify that the 'web' filter chain has the 'cert' filter selected:
    <p><img src="/img/tutorials/2014-06-04-geomesa-authorizations/cert9.jpg" alt="Web Filter Panel"></p>
</li>
</ol>

#### Install an LDAP Server for Storing Authorizations



*Note: If you are already have an LDAP server set up, you can skip this step.*

1. Download and install [ApacheDS](http://directory.apache.org/apacheds/)
2. Either run as a service, or run through the start scripts:

{% highlight bash %}
cd apacheds-2.0.0-M16/bin
chmod 755 *.sh
./apacheds.sh 
{% endhighlight %}

#### Configure LDAP for Storing Authorizations

We want to configure LDAP with a user to match the Spring Security PKIs we are testing with. The end result we want is to create the following user:

```DN: cn=rod,ou=Spring Security,o=Spring Framework```

In order to do that, we will use Apache Directory Studio.

1. Download and run [Apache Directory Studio](http://directory.apache.org/studio/)
2. Connect to the your LDAP instance (ApacheDS), using the instructions [here](http://directory.apache.org/apacheds/basic-ug/1.4.2-changing-admin-password.html)
(note: you do not need to change the password unless you want to)
3. Create a partition for our data:
    1. Right-click the 'ApacheDS (localhost)' entry under the 'Connection' tab and select 'Open Configuration'
    2. Click 'Advanced Partitions Configuration...'
    3. Click 'Add'
    4. Set the ID field to be 'Spring Framework'
    5. Set the Suffix field to be 'o=Spring Framework'
    6. Uncheck 'Auto-generate context entry from suffix DN'
    7. Set the following attributes in Context Entry:
        * objectclass: extensibleObject
        * objectclass: top
        * objectclass: domain
        * dc: Spring Framework2
        * o: Spring Framework2
    8. Hit ctrl-s to save the partition
    ![ApacheDS Partition](/img/tutorials/2014-06-04-geomesa-authorizations/apache-ds-partition.png)
4. **Re-start ApacheDS** - otherwise the partition will not be available and the LDIF import will fail.
5. Load the following LDIF file, which will create the Spring Security OU and the rod user:
    * Right-click the 'Root DSE' node in the LDAP browser, and select 'Import->LDIF import...'
    [Spring Security LDIF](/assets/tutorials/2014-06-04-geomesa-authorizations/spring-security-rod.ldif)

#### Test LDAP Connection Using Tutorial Code

The tutorial code includes an AuthorizationsProvider implementation that will connect to LDAP to retrieve authorizations: 

* ```geomesa.tutorial.LdapAuthorizationsProvider```

The provider will configure itself based on the 'geomesa-ldap.properties' file on the classpath (under src/main/resources):

{% highlight properties %}
# ldap connection properties
java.naming.factory.initial=com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory
java.naming.provider.url=ldap://localhost:10389
java.naming.security.authentication=simple
java.naming.security.principal=uid=admin,ou=system
java.naming.security.credentials=secret

# the ldap node to start the query from
geomesa.ldap.search.root=o=Spring Framework
# the query that will be applied to find the user's record
# the '{}' will be replaced with the common name from the certificate the user has logged into geoserver with
geomesa.ldap.search.filter=(&(objectClass=person)(cn={}))
# the ldap attribute that holds the comma-delimited authorizations for the user
geomesa.ldap.auths.attribute=employeeType
{% endhighlight %}

The default file included with the tutorial will connect to the LDAP instance we set up in the previous steps. If you are using a different LDAP configuration,
you will need to modify the file appropriately.

The LdapAuthorizationsProvider will look for a particular LDAP attribute that stores the user's
authorizations in a comma-delimited list. For simplicity, in this tutorial we have re-purposed an
existing attribute, ```employeeType```. The attribute to use can be modified through the property file.

When we inserted the 'rod' record into LDAP, we set his employeeType to 'user,admin', corresponding
to our Accumulo authorizations. If you are using different authorizations, you will need to update
the attribute to match.

The tutorial code includes a test case for connecting to LDAP:

* ```geomesa.tutorial.LdapAuthorizationsProviderTest```

Once you have modified geomesa-ldap.properties to connect to your LDAP, you can test the connection
by building the project and running the test class: 

{% highlight bash %}
mvn clean install

java -cp ./target/geomesa-tutorial-authorizations-accumulo1.5-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
   geomesa.tutorial.LdapAuthorizationsProviderTest rod
{% endhighlight %}

Where the argument to the program is the user to retrieve authorizations for.

You should get the following output:

{% highlight bash %}
Checking auths from LDAP for user 'rod'
Retrieved auths: user,admin
{% endhighlight %}

#### Installing the LDAP AuthorizationProvider in GeoServer

In order to use the LdapAuthorizationsProvider, we need to install it as a service provider into
GeoServer, where it will automatically be picked up by GeoMesa.

The tutorial code includes a service provider registry in the META-INF/services folder. By default, 
the provider class is specified as the EmptyAuthorizationsProvider.

<ol>
<li>Ensure that you ldap configuration is correct by running the LdapAuthorizationsProviderTest, as
described above.</li>
<li>Change the provider class in 'src/main/resources/META-INF/services/geomesa.core.security.AuthorizationsProvider'
to be <code>geomesa.tutorial.LdapAuthorizationsProvider</code></li>
<li>Re-build the tutorial jar and install the <b>unshaded original</b> jar in GeoServer:

{% highlight bash %}
mvn clean install
cp ./target/original-geomesa-tutorial-authorizations-accumulo1.5-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
   /path/to/tomcat/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib/
{% endhighlight %}

<i>Note: we want to use the unshaded jar since all the required dependencies are already installed in GeoServer.</i>
</li>
<li>Re-start GeoServer (or start it if not running)</li>
</ol>

At this point you should have everything configured and in-place.

#### Verifying the LDAP Authorizations in GeoServer

In order to verify that the authorizations are working correctly, execute a query against GeoMesa by
calling the WMS provider *over https* in your browser:

{% highlight bash %}
https://localhost:8443/geoserver/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetMap&layers=geomesa:gdelt_auths&styles=&bbox=31.6,44,37.4,47.75&width=1200&height=600&srs=EPSG:4326&format=application/openlayers&TIME=2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z/2014-04-30T23:00:00.000Z
{% endhighlight %}

When prompted, select the 'rod' certificate.

You should see the normal data come back, with many red points indicating the data:

![Authorized Results](/img/tutorials/2014-06-04-geomesa-authorizations/Ukraine_Unfiltered.png)

Now try the same query, but use the 'scott' certificate. This time, there should be no data returned,
as the 'scott' user does not have any authorizations set up in LDAP.

*Note: a simple way to use different certificates at once is to open multiple 'incognito' or
'private' browser windows.*

### Querying GeoServer through WFS with a Java Client

GeoServer provides the ability to query data through a Web Feature Service (WFS). Using GeoTools, we
can create a client in Java through a WFSDataStore. More details are available
[here](http://docs.geotools.org/latest/userguide/library/data/wfs.html) and
[here](http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/services/wfs/reference.html), although some of the
documentation is out of date.

We can leverage the same PKI and LDAP setup that we used through the web interface to authenticate
our client.

Go back to the tutorial folder, and execute the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
java -cp ./target/geomesa-tutorial-authorizations-accumulo1.5-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
   -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/path/to/certs/rod.p12 \
   -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=password \
   -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStoreType=PKCS12 \
   -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/certs/server.jks \
   -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=password \
   -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=JKS
   geomesa.tutorial.GeoServerAuthorizationsTutorial \
   -geoserverUrl <url> \
   -featureStore <featureStore> \
{% endhighlight %}

where you provide the following arguments:

* ```<url>``` - the *HTTPS* path to GeoServer, e.g. "https://localhost:8443/geoserver/"
* ```<featureStore>``` - the name of the data store created in GeoServer, including the workspace,
e.g. geomesa:gdelt
* ```javax.net.ssl.*``` - SSL configuration system properties. Note that these need to be before the
class name, otherwise they will be treated as arguments to the program.

*Note: ensure that the URL for GeoServer is using HTTPS.*

*Note: the feature store needs to be namespaced with the GeoServer workspace. The workspace and
store name are separated with a colon.*

*Note: if you happen to have two GeoServer data stores with the same name but different workspaces,
you will need to delete or rename one of them. There is a bug in GeoServer where it might return
the wrong features if there are two data stores with the same name.*

The system properties will control the keystore that is used for authentication. For the first command,
we are using the 'rod' certificate.

Upon execution, you should see the following output:

{% highlight bash %}
Executing query against 'https://localhost:8443/geoserver/wfs?request=GetCapabilities&version=1.0.0' with client keystore '/path/to/certs/rod.p12'
INFO: Cached XML schema: https://localhost:8443/geoserver/wfs?service=WFS&version=1.0.0&request=DescribeFeatureType&typeName=geomesa%3Agdelt
Results:

If you re-execute the command, but use the 'scott.p12' cert instead, you should get no results:

{% highlight bash %}
Executing query against 'https://localhost:8443/geoserver/wfs?request=GetCapabilities&version=1.0.0' with client keystore '/path/to/certs/scott.p12'
INFO: Cached XML schema: https://localhost:8443/geoserver/wfs?service=WFS&version=1.0.0&request=DescribeFeatureType&typeName=geomesa%3Agdelt
No results
{% endhighlight %}

### Insight Into How the Tutorial Works

The code for querying through WFS is available in the following class:

* ```geomesa.tutorial.GeoServerAuthorizationsTutorial```

The interesting code for this tutorial is contained in the 'main' method:

{% highlight java %}
// create the URL to GeoServer. Note that we need to point to the 'GetCapabilities' request,
// and that we are using WFS version 1.0.0
String geoserverUrl = geoserverHost + "wfs?request=GetCapabilities&version=1.0.0";

// create the geotools configuration for a WFS data store
Map<String, String> configuration = new HashMap<String, String>();
configuration.put(WFSDataStoreFactory.URL.key, geoserverUrl);
configuration.put(WFSDataStoreFactory.WFS_STRATEGY.key, "geoserver");
configuration.put(WFSDataStoreFactory.TIMEOUT.key, cmd.getOptionValue(SetupUtil.TIMEOUT, "99999"));

...

// verify we have gotten the correct datastore
WFSDataStore wfsDataStore = (WFSDataStore) DataStoreFinder.getDataStore(configuration);
{% endhighlight %}

This code snippet shows how you can get a GeoTools data store that connects to GeoServer through WFS.
Once you have obtained the data store, you can query it just like any other data store, and the
implementation details will be transparent to you.
