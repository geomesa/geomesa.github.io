## Introduction

Feature visibility is a new and important feature recently supported by GeoMesa. Accumulo has support for cell-level visibility built-in, and in recent versions of GeoMesa,
support was added to utilize these visibility markings and enhance data security.
<!--more-->
From the Accumulo user guide:

> Accumulo extends the BigTable data model to implement a security mechanism known as cell-level security. Every key-value pair has its own security label, stored under the column visibility element of the key, which is used to determine whether a given user meets the security requirements to read the value. This enables data of various security levels to be stored within the same row, and users of varying degrees of access to query the same table, while preserving data confidentiality.

In this tutorial, you'll be guided through ingesting data with varying levels of visibility and querying that data as different users through GeoServer.

## Prerequisites

If you haven't already read through both the [GeoMesa Deployment Tutorial](/geomesa-deployment/) and the [Quickstart tutorial](/geomesa-quickstart/) and
make sure you have gone through the initial setup of GeoMesa. We'll be using a customized version of the data generated by the GeoMesa Quickstart project.

Additionally, you should be familiar with [Accumulo's Security Label Expression Syntax](https://accumulo.apache.org/1.4/user_manual/Security.html#Security_Label_Expression_Syntax), which we make use of when writing a visibility label to features in GeoMesa.

## Switching to the "feature_level_visibility" branch

In your geomesa-quickstart directory, checkout the branch "feature_level_visibility" and build with Maven:

{% highlight bash %}
cd geomesa-quickstart
git pull origin master
git checkout feature_level_visibility
mvn clean install
{% endhighlight %}

## Understanding the code

If you inspect the Quickstart code in your editor of choice, you'll notice only a few changes from the original Quickstart project. The main change is that the
SimpleFeatureType has an additional attribute, `Visibility`, added to it. This attribute will assist later in testing that features were written with the appropriate
Accumulo visibilities.

Additionally, if you look at line 169, you'll see:

{% highlight scala %}
  if (i % 2 == 0) {
      simpleFeature.setAttribute("Visibility", "admin");
      SecurityUtils.setFeatureVisibility(simpleFeature, "admin");
  } else {
      simpleFeature.setAttribute("Visibility", "user|admin");
      SecurityUtils.setFeatureVisibility(simpleFeature, "user|admin");
  }
{% endhighlight %}

This is where the visibility is being set in Accumulo. The line

{% highlight scala %}
simpleFeature.getUserData().put(SecurityUtils.FEATURE_VISIBILITY, "admin")
{% endhighlight %}

is adding a key-value pair to the SimpleFeature's userData, where the string "geomesa.feature.visibility" -> (maps to) "user". In GeoMesa, this key-value pair is read out of the SimpleFeature, and the appropriate Accumulo
visibility string is applied to the feature.

This means that the feature `simpleFeature` will be written to GeoMesa with the visibility `admin`, where only users that have been granted the authorization level of `admin` will be able to view the feature in GeoMesa.

That's it for changes in the Quickstart project! Easy, right? So, to add visibility to a GeoMesa feature, simply add a line that looks like this when creating or writing a SimpleFeature:

{% highlight scala %}
simpleFeature.getUserData().put(SecurityUtils.FEATURE_VISIBILITY, "{visibility-string-here}");
{% endhighlight %}

Now, when users query GeoMesa, or when data gets read out of Accumulo by GeoServer, only users with the correct level of authorization will be able to read the feature.

In the Quickstart example, 500 features are written with the visibility `admin` and 500 are written with `user|admin`. However, unless users are explicitly granted permissions to read these tables and read features with that level of authorization, we cannot visualize the data in a meaningful way. Let's continue on and add new Accumulo users to do just that.

## Adding new Accumulo users

In this part of the tutorial, we'll get familiar with the Accumulo shell. First, login to the Accumulo shell with:

{% highlight bash %}
accumulo shell -u {username-here} -p {password-here}
# OR
accumulo shell -u {username-here} //Accumulo will prompt for your password if you don't want it to be written in plaintext to your shell history
{% endhighlight %}

Next, you should be greeted with something similar to this:

{% highlight bash %}
Shell - Apache Accumulo Interactive Shell
-
- version: 1.5.0
- instance name: accumulo
- instance id: {instance-id}
-
- type 'help' for a list of available commands
-
{username-here}@accumulo>
{% endhighlight %}

Now, we're ready to add new users to Accumulo with the Accumulo shell `createuser` command. At the prompt, run:

{% highlight bash %}
createuser user
Enter new password for 'user': ***********
Please confirm new password for 'user': ***********
createuser admin
Enter new password for 'admin': ***********
Please confirm new password for 'admin': ***********
{% endhighlight %}

With these new users added, we're going to give them the proper authorizations with the `setauths` command:

{% highlight bash %}
setauths -s admin,user -u admin
setauths -s user -u user
{% endhighlight %}

This will grant authorizations `admin,user` to `admin`, meaning as the user `admin`, one will be able to read both features written with the visibility `user` and features written with the visibility `admin`.
Additionally, the user `user` will be granted `user` authorizations, meaning they can only view features of visibility `user`. They will never see features written with the visibility `admin`.

Let's move to GeoServer to visualize feature level visibility.

## GeoServer visualization

Assuming you have already set up GeoServer according to the original Quickstart tutorial, we're going to add a new DataStore to GeoServer. First, login to GeoServer, and then click "Add stores" from the homepage.

Next, click the link to add a new "Accumulo Feature Data Store" and name it "quickstart-feature-level-visibility-admin". Fill in the correct connection parameters to make contact with GeoMesa/Accumulo, but be sure to use `admin` for the "user" parameter.

!["GeoMesa DataStore configuration with \"admin\" user"](/img/tutorials/2015-03-30-geomesa-feature-level-visibility/admin-config.png)

Then, publish your layer when prompted by GeoServer. Remember to click the "Compute from data" and "Compute from native bounds" links on the Add Layer page, and click save.

Repeat the above steps one more time to add an additional DataStore with the same parameters, but this time, use `user` for the "user" parameter.

!["GeoMesa DataStore configuration with \"user\" user"](/img/tutorials/2015-03-30-geomesa-feature-level-visibility/user-config.png)

With your layers added in GeoServer, we're nearly ready to visualize the data. One final step is adding our custom SLD that will style your features to make visualizations of the data even easier to understand. [You can find it here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geomesa/geomesa-quickstart/feature_level_visibility/featureLevelVisibility.xml)

Download this XML file, or copy the contents, and add it as a Style in GeoServer. It will style the points on a map based on the visibility attribute present.

Lastly, click on "Layer Preview" in the left hand sidebar and find your two newly added layers. If everything went correctly, you should see fewer results returning in the `user` layer than in the `admin` layer, and this is expected behavior. Because `user` has only been granted permission to view features with the `user` visibility, only those 500 records are returned. However, the `admin` user is granted permission to see both `admin` and `user` visibilities.

## Expanding this concept

In this very simple example, you wrote features of two different visibilities, added two new users to Accumulo, and granted them separate authorization levels to be able to view portions of the data.
This tutorial has real-world use cases in security and data integrity. For example, when storing sensitive data and having users of varying authorization and security levels querying that data,
visibility labels ensure that sensitive data is not leaked to a user of a lower level of security.

The concept of feature level visibility can be extended and modified to have many more, or only a few, visibility levels. And with GeoServer being flexible and extensible, writing a module to consider feature
level security in GeoServer is relatively painless.

At CCRi, we've implemented a very small, example Java class that does a simple match on the username provided by GeoServer. Our example class then
matches the username to a level of authorization specified in the class and hands this off to an AuthorizationsProvider in GeoMesa. This AuthorizationsProvider uses
the correct level of authorization when querying Accumulo, no matter the user that is specified in the GeoServer DataStore. This allows us to have only one layer per
DataSource, rather than what is in the example above, that many users of varying authorizations levels can hit and return only the data granted to their level of security.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you learned about feature level visibility and security built into GeoMesa. You ingested a dataset of 1000 features to your GeoMesa instance -- 500 having the visibility `admin` and 500 having the visibility `user|admin`.
You added two new users to Accumulo and granted them the correct authorization levels to query the data. Finally, you visualized the data and saw how, despite both DataStore connecting to the same
features in GeoMesa, `user` could only have a subset of those features returned because of the lower security authorization.
