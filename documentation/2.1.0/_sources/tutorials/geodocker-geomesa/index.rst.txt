GeoDocker GeoMesa
=================

The GeoDocker-GeoMesa project makes standing up a GeoMesa cluster
running on Accumulo very easy. Currently we support running a
GeoDocker-GeoMesa cluster locally (on a single machine) and on an
AWS cluster. Other deployment setups are possible, but we don't
provide ready-made scripts. The tutorials below will guide you
through the respective process.
