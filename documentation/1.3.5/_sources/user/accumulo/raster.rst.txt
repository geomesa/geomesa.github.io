GeoMesa Raster
==============

The Raster support in GeoMesa (in the ``geomesa-accumulo/geomesa-accumulo-raster`` module)
is currently limited in scope and has a few important caveats that
are noted here.

The Raster support was intended to contain image pyramids that are
EPSG:4326 with tiles on the order of Kb in size. Any rasters attempted
to be ingested will need to be tiled prior to ingest, and the tiles must
have disjoint extents. Currently only single band images are supported.
Sharding is not currently used to spread the table across the cluster.

Ingest
------

Currently ingest is accomplished by using the ``ingest-raster`` command
in the GeoMesa Accumulo command line tools. See :ref:`accumulo_tools_raster` for more
information.

GeoServer
---------

The GeoMesa-GeoServer plugin contains the GeoMesaCoverageFormat which is
used via the GeoServer UI to create a store for GeoMesa Raster table.
Once a layer is published the data can be queried via WMS and WCS 1.0.0.
Currently the Plugin is biased to grab tiles at a finer spatial
resolution than the wms query window, and will down-sample the mosaic.

Building Instructions
---------------------

If you wish to build this project separately, you can with mvn clean
install

::

    geomesa/geomesa-accumulo/geomesa-accumulo-raster$ mvn clean install

This will produce a JAR in ``target``.
