Accumulo Data Store
===================

The GeoMesa Accumulo Data Store module is an implementation of the
GeoTools ``DataStore`` that is backed by `Apache Accumulo`_. GeoMesa
also contains many other modules designed to operate with Accumulo,
found in ``geomesa-accumulo`` in the source distribution.
This includes client code and distributed iterator code for the
Accumulo tablet servers.
