Feature Level Visibility and Security
=====================================

GeoMesa supports security on a per-feature level, leveraging Accumulo's
support for built-in cell-level visibility. This allows data to be
filtered on a granular level for different users. From the Accumulo user
guide:

    Accumulo extends the BigTable data model to implement a security
    mechanism known as cell-level security. Every key-value pair has its
    own security label, stored under the column visibility element of
    the key, which is used to determine whether a given user meets the
    security requirements to read the value. This enables data of
    various security levels to be stored within the same row, and users
    of varying degrees of access to query the same table, while
    preserving data confidentiality.

In this tutorial, we'll go through ingesting data with varying levels of
visibility and querying that data as different users through GeoServer.

Prerequisites
-------------

You will need:

-  an Accumulo |accumulo_version| instance running on Hadoop |hadoop_version|,
-  an Accumulo user that has appropriate permissions to manage
   authorizations and query data,
-  `Java JDK
   8 <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`__,
-  `Apache Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`__ |maven_version|, and
-  a `git <http://git-scm.com/>`__ client

If you haven't already read both the :ref:`installation` section of
the GeoMesa User Manual and the  :doc:`geomesa-quickstart-accumulo`, you should do so now,
and make sure you have gone through the initial setup of GeoMesa.

Additionally, you should be familiar with Accumulo's `Security Label
Expression
Syntax <https://accumulo.apache.org/1.7/accumulo_user_manual.html#_security_label_expressions>`__,
which we make use of when securing features in GeoMesa.

Download and Build the Tutorial
-------------------------------

Pick a reasonable directory on your machine, and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/geomesa/geomesa-tutorials.git
    $ cd geomesa-tutorials

.. note::

    You may need to download a particular release of the tutorials project
    to target a particular GeoMesa release. See :ref:`tutorial_versions`.

To build, run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mvn clean install -pl geomesa-examples-featurelevelvis

.. note::

    Ensure that the version of Accumulo, Hadoop, etc in
    the root ``pom.xml`` match your environment.

.. note::

    Depending on the version, you may also need to build GeoMesa locally.
    Instructions can be found under :ref:`installation`.

Run the Tutorial
----------------

On the command-line, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ java -cp geomesa-examples-featurelevelvis/target/geomesa-examples-featurelevelvis-${geomesa.version}.jar \
        com.example.geomesa.accumulo.FeatureLevelVisibility \
        -instanceId <instance>                              \
        -zookeepers <zookeepers>                            \
        -user <user>                                        \
        -password <password>                                \
        -tableName <table>

where you provide the following arguments:

-  ``<instance>`` the name of your Accumulo instance
-  ``<zookeepers>`` your Zookeeper nodes, separated by commas
-  ``<user>`` the name of an Accumulo user that has permissions to
   create, read and write tables
-  ``<password>`` the password for the previously-mentioned Accumulo
   user
-  ``<table>`` the name of the destination table that will accept these
   test records; this table should either not exist or should be empty

You should see output on creating and querying the simple features.

Understanding The Code
----------------------

If you inspect the code, you'll notice only a few changes from the
original Accumulo Quick Start project. The main change is that the
``SimpleFeatureType`` has an additional attribute, "visibility", added
to it. This attribute will assist later in testing that features were
written with the appropriate Accumulo visibilities.

Additionally, if you look in the ``createNewFeatures`` method, you'll
see:

.. code-block:: java

    if (i % 2 == 0) {
        simpleFeature.setAttribute("Visibility", "admin");
        SecurityUtils.setFeatureVisibility(simpleFeature, "admin");
    } else {
        simpleFeature.setAttribute("Visibility", "user|admin");
        SecurityUtils.setFeatureVisibility(simpleFeature, "user|admin");
    }

This is where visibilities are being set in Accumulo. The line

.. code-block:: java

    SecurityUtils.setFeatureVisibility(simpleFeature, "admin");

is adding storing the visibility in the ``SimpleFeature``'s user data.
When writing to Accumulo, GeoMesa will use that user data to apply the
appropriate Accumulo visibility string to the record.

Because the feature has a visibility of ``admin``, only users with the
``admin`` authorization will be able to see the feature.

In the Quickstart example, 500 features are written with the visibility
``admin`` and 500 are written with ``user|admin``. However, unless users
are explicitly granted permissions to read these tables and read
features with that level of authorization, we cannot visualize the data
in a meaningful way. Next we will add new Accumulo users to do just
that.

Adding New Accumulo Users
-------------------------

In this part of the tutorial, we'll get familiar with the Accumulo
shell. First, login to Accumulo with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ accumulo shell -u <username>

Accumulo will prompt you for your password. You should then see
something similar to this:

.. code-block:: bash

    Shell - Apache Accumulo Interactive Shell
    -
    - version: 1.5.0
    - instance name: accumulo
    - instance id: {instance-id}
    -
    - type 'help' for a list of available commands
    -
    {username-here}@accumulo>

Now, we're ready to add new users to Accumulo with the Accumulo shell
``createuser`` command. At the prompt, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    > createuser user
    Enter new password for 'user': ***********
    Please confirm new password for 'user': ***********
    > createuser admin
    Enter new password for 'admin': ***********
    Please confirm new password for 'admin': ***********

With these new users added, we're going to give them the proper
authorizations with the ``setauths`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    > setauths -s admin,user -u admin
    > setauths -s user -u user

This will grant authorizations ``admin,user`` to ``admin``, meaning as
the user ``admin``, one will be able to read both features written with
the visibility ``user`` and features written with the visibility
``admin``. Additionally, the user ``user`` will be granted ``user``
authorizations, meaning they can only view features of visibility
``user``. They will never see features written with the visibility
``admin``.

Next we'll grant permissions to the read the appropriate tables to
``user`` and ``admin``.

.. code-block:: bash

    > grant -u user -p <table>.* Table.READ
    > grant -u admin -p <table>.* Table.READ

To verify user permissions you can switch users in the accumulo console
by using:

.. code-block:: bash

    > user admin
    Enter password for user admin: ******

We can now move to the table we'd like to verify. Here we use
``<table>_z2_v2`` but any valid table will work.

.. code-block:: bash

    > table <table>_z2_v2
    > scan
    \x01\x00\x0C0\xB0Pf\x0A&\x19Observation.99 F: [user|admin]    \x02\x00\x00\x00CAddam\xF3\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00c\x01\x00\x00\x01H\xAC\xB4;\xB0\x01\x08\x03\xC0Sz\x1Ff\x15}H\xC0C(\xC5jq\x08\x8F\x7F\xF8\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x80user|admi\xEE\x05\x0B\x14\x1D89
    \x01\x00\x0C0\xB22\xB7-\xA4;Observation.585 F: [user|admin]    \x02\x00\x00\x00CAddam\xF3\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x02I\x01\x00\x00\x01DUby\xE8\x01\x08\x03\xC0S\x7F\xDF\x0Aw\xD9\x14\xC0C\x19\xA4\xFC{\xE7\xA6\x7F\xF8\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x80user|admi\xEE\x05\x0B\x14\x1D89
    ---------------hit any key to continue or 'q' to quit ------------------

``scan`` should return a sample of the data if everything is configured
correctly.

Let's move on to GeoServer to visualize feature level visibility.

GeoServer Visualization
-----------------------

Assuming you have already set up GeoServer as described in the GeoMesa
User Manual, we're going to add a new ``DataStore`` to GeoServer. First,
login to GeoServer, and then click "Add stores" from the homepage.

Next, click the link to add a new "Accumulo (GeoMesa)" store and name it
``feature-level-visibility-admin``. Fill in the correct connection
parameters to make contact with GeoMesa/Accumulo, but be sure to use
``admin`` for the "user" parameter.

.. figure:: _static/geomesa-examples-featurelevelvis/gs-admin-datastore.png
   :alt: GeoMesa DataStore configuration with "admin" user

   GeoMesa DataStore configuration with "admin" user

Then, publish your layer when prompted by GeoServer. Remember to click
the "Compute from data" and "Compute from native bounds" links on the
"Add Layer" page, and click "Save".

Repeat the above steps one more time to add an additional ``DataStore``
with the same parameters, but this time, name it
``feature-level-visibility-user`` and use ``user`` for the "user"
parameter.

With your layers added in GeoServer, we're nearly ready to visualize the
data. One final step is adding our custom SLD that will style your
features to make visualizations of the data even easier to understand.

Download :download:`feature-level-vis.sld <_static/geomesa-examples-featurelevelvis/feature-level-vis.sld>`,
or copy the contents, and add it as a Style in GeoServer. It will style the points on
a map based on the visibility attribute present.

Lastly, click on "Layer Preview" in the left hand sidebar and find your
two newly added layers. If everything went correctly, you should see
fewer results returning in the ``user`` layer than in the ``admin``
layer, and this is expected behavior. Because ``user`` has only been
granted permission to view features with the ``user`` visibility, only
those 500 records are returned. However, the ``admin`` user is granted
permission to see both ``admin`` and ``user`` visibilities.

Expanding The Concept
---------------------

In this very simple example, you wrote features of two different
visibilities, added two new users to Accumulo, and granted them separate
authorization levels to be able to view portions of the data. This
tutorial has real-world use cases in security and data integrity. For
example, when storing sensitive data and having users of varying
authorization and security levels querying that data, visibility labels
ensure that sensitive data is not leaked to a user of a lower level of
security.

The concept of feature level visibility can be extended and modified to
have many more, or only a few, visibility levels. And with GeoServer
being flexible and extensible, writing a module to consider feature
level security in GeoServer is relatively painless.

GeoMesa also provides a mechanism to have authorizations applied on a
per-user level, instead of a per-datastore level. More information,
including integration with PKI and LDAP, can be found in the Authorizations
tutorial under :ref:`authorizations-gs-pki-ldap`.

Conclusion
----------

In this tutorial, you learned about feature level visibility and
security built into GeoMesa. You ingested a dataset of 1000 features to
your GeoMesa instance -- 500 having the visibility ``admin`` and 500
having the visibility ``user|admin``. You added two new users to
Accumulo and granted them the correct authorization levels to query the
data. Finally, you visualized the data and saw how, despite both
``DataStore`` connecting to the same features in GeoMesa, ``user`` could
only have a subset of those features returned because of the lower
security authorization.
