GeoMesa NiFi Quick Start
========================

This tutorial provides an example implementation for using GeoMesa with
NiFi. This walk-through will guide you in setting up the components
required for ingesting GDELT files into GeoMesa running on Accumulo.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, you must have the following:

-  an instance of Accumulo 1.7 or 1.8 running on Hadoop 2.2 or better
-  an Accumulo user that has both create-table and write permissions
-  the GeoMesa Accumulo distributed runtime `installed for your Accumulo
   instance <http://www.geomesa.org/documentation/user/installation_and_configuration.html#installing-the-accumulo-distributed-runtime-library>`__
-  a local copy of the `Java <http://java.oracle.com/>`__ JDK 8
-  Apache `Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`__ installed
-  an instance of Apache `NiFi <http://nifi.apache.org/>`__ 0.4.1 or
   better
-  (Optional) an installation of `GeoServer <http://geoserver.org/>`__
   with the `GeoMesa Accumulo GeoServer
   plugin <http://www.geomesa.org/documentation/user/accumulo/install.html#install-accumulo-geoserver>`__
   to visualize the ingested data.
-  a GitHub client installed

About this Tutorial
-------------------

This QuickStart operates by reading csv files from ``/tmp/gdelt/`` and
using the PutGeoMesa processor, ingests the files into GeoMesa running
on Accumulo.

Obtain GDELT data
-----------------

In this QuickStart we will be ingesting GDELT data. If you already have
some GDELT data available locally or previously ran the `Map-Reduce
Ingest of
GDELT <http://www.geomesa.org/documentation/tutorials/geomesa-examples-gdelt.html>`__
example then you may skip this section. Simply copy the data you have
into /tmp/gdelt.

The `GDELT Event database <http://www.gdeltproject.org>`__ provides a
comprehensive time- and location-indexed archive of events reported in
broadcast, print, and web news media worldwide from 1979 to today. You
can download raw GDELT data files at
http://data.gdeltproject.org/events/index.html. For example, the
following Bash commands use ``wget`` to download all event files for
2013 (2 GB compressed, 14 GB uncompressed) and ``md5sum`` to verify each
by their MD5 hash:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir /tmp/gdelt && cd /tmp/gdelt 
    $ wget http://data.gdeltproject.org/events/md5sums 
    $ for file in `cat md5sums | cut -d' ' -f3 | grep '^2013'` ; do wget http://data.gdeltproject.org/events/$file ; done 
    $ md5sum -c md5sums 2>&1 | grep '^2013' 
    $ unzip '*.zip'

Download and Build the GeoMesa NiFi project
-------------------------------------------

Pick a reasonable directory on your machine, and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/geomesa/geomesa-nifi.git
    $ cd geomesa-nifi

To build, run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mvn clean install

This will build three processors.

-  PutGeoMesa - Ingest data into GeoMesa with a GeoMesa converter or
   from geoavro
-  PutGeoTools - Ingest data into an arbitrary GeoTools Datastore based
   on parameters using a GeoMesa converter or avro
-  ConvertToGeoAvro - Use a GeoMesa converter to create geoavro

However we will only be using the PutGeoMesa for this QuickStart.

Install the GeoMesa Processor
-----------------------------

Install the GeoMesa NiFi Processor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use NiFi with GeoMesa we need to first install the GeoMesa
processor. To do this simply copy the ``geomesa-nifi-nar-$VERSION.nar``
that you just built from ``geomesa-nifi/geomesa-nifi-nar/target`` to the
``lib/`` directory of you NiFi installation.

Install the SFTs and Converters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additionally we need to copy the ``geomesa-accumulo-$VERSION-data.jar``
from the geomesa-accumulo-dist to the ``lib/`` of the NiFi installation.
The ``geomesa-accumulo-$VERSION-data.jar`` is located in the
``dist/sfts-converters`` directory of the geomesa-accumulo-dist. This
jar contains the sfts and converters needed for GeoMesa to ingest the
GDELT data. You can obtain the geomesa-accumulo-dist from
`here <https://repo.locationtech.org/content/repositories/geomesa-releases/org/locationtech/geomesa/geomesa-accumulo-dist_2.11/1.3.1/geomesa-accumulo-dist_2.11-1.3.1-bin.tar.gz>`__
or you may build it locally if you have geomesa source available using:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mvn clean install -am -pl :geomesa-accumulo-dist_2.11

Upload the NiFi flow template
-----------------------------

The NiFi template provided
`here <_static/geomesa-quickstart-nifi/GeoMesa_Quickstart.xml>`__ sets
up a basic NiFi flow from a GetFile processor to a PutGeoMesa processor.
To upload the NiFi template, download it to your local machine and in
NiFi select the ``Upload Template`` option in the ``Operate`` side
panel. After uploading the template you can add it to the workspace by
dragging the ``New Template`` option from the NiFi main header into the
workspace and selecting the template from the drop down. You will need
to configure the PutGeoMesa processor for your Accumulo Instance. Simply
edit the PutGeoMesa configuration and edit the following properties:

-  ``instanceId`` Your Accumulo instance ID.
-  ``zookeepers`` A comma separated list of zookeeper IPs or hostnames.
-  ``user`` Accumulo username that has both create-table and write
   permissions.
-  ``password`` Password to above user.

.. warning::

    If you have set up the GeoMesa Accumulo distributed
    runtime to be isolated within a namespace `as described in the
    GeoMesa installation
    guide <http://www.geomesa.org/documentation/user/installation_and_configuration.html#for-accumulo-1-6>`__,
    the value of ``tableName`` should include the namespace (e.g.
    ``myNamespace.gdelt``).

Visualize Data With GeoServer
-----------------------------

Register the GeoMesa store with GeoServer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Log into GeoServer using your user and password credentials. Click
"Stores" and "Add new Store". If you do not see the Accumulo Feature
Data Store listed under Vector Data Sources, ensure the plugin is in the
right directory and restart GeoServer.

Select the ``Accumulo Feature Data Store`` vector data source, and enter
the following parameters:

-  basic store info
-  ``workspace`` this is dependent upon your GeoServer installation
-  ``data source name`` pick a sensible name, such as,
   ``geomesa_nifi_quick_start``
-  ``description`` this is strictly decorative;
   ``GeoMesa NiFi quick start``
-  connection parameters
-  these are the same parameter values that you supplied to the
   processor when you ran the tutorial; they describe how to connect to
   the Accumulo instance where your data resides.

Click "Save", and GeoServer will search your Accumulo table for any
GeoMesa-managed feature types.

Publish the layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GeoServer should recognize the feature type, and should present that as
a layer that could be published. Click on the "Publish" link.

You will be taken to the Edit Layer screen. Two of the tabs need to be
updated: Data and Dimensions.

In the Data pane, enter values for the bounding boxes. In this case, you
can click on the link to compute these values from the data.

In the Dimensions tab, check the "Enabled" checkbox under Time. Then
select "When" in the Attribute and End Attribute dropdowns, and
"Continuous Interval" in the Presentation dropdown.

Click on the "Save" button when you are done.

Take a look
~~~~~~~~~~~

Click on the "Layer Preview" link in the left-hand gutter. If you don't
see the quick-start layer on the first page of results, enter the name
of the layer you just created into the search box, and press .

Once you see your layer, click on the "OpenLayers" link, which will open
a new tab. By default, the display that opens will not show all the
data, because we have enabled the time dimension for this layer, but the
preview does not specify a time. In the URL bar for the visualization,
add the following to the end:

``&TIME=2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z/2014-01-31T23:59:59.999Z``

That tells GeoServer to display the records for the entire month of
January 2014. You can find more information about the TIME parameter
from `GeoServer's
documentation <http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/services/wms/time.html>`__.

Once you press , the display will update, and you should see a
collection of red dots similar to the following image.

Tweaking the display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are just a few simple ways you can play with the visualization:

-  Click on one of the red points in the display, and GeoServer will
   report the detail records underneath the map area.
-  Shift-click to highlight a region within the map that you would like
   to zoom into.
-  Alter the ``TIME=`` parameter in the URL to a different date range,
   and you can filter to see only the records that satisfy the temporal
   constraint.
-  Click on the "Toggle options toolbar" icon in the upper-left corner
   of the preview window. The right-hand side of the screen will include
   a "Filter" text box. Enter ``Who = 'Bierce'``, and press on the
   "play" icon. The display will now show only those points matching
   your filter criterion. This is a CQL filter, which can be constructed
   in various ways to query our data. You can find more information
   about CQL from `GeoServer's CQL
   tutorial <http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/tutorials/cql/cql_tutorial.html>`__.

Generating Heatmaps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  To try out the DensityIterator, you can install the Heatmap SLD from
   the `GDELT Tutorial <../geomesa-examples-gdelt>`__.
-  After configuring the SLD, in the URL, change ``styles=`` to be
   ``styles=heatmap&density=true``. Once you press , the display will
   change to a density heat-map. (NB: For this to work, you will have to
   first install the WPS module for GeoServer. See the official web site
   for a download.)
