Ingest Commands
===============

These commands are used to insert and delete simple features. Required parameters are indicated with a ``*``.

``delete-features``
-------------------

Delete specific features from a schema. Note that if deleting all features, it may be faster to delete the
schema and re-create it.

======================== =========================================================
Argument                 Description
======================== =========================================================
``-c, --catalog *``      The catalog table containing schema metadata
``-f, --feature-name *`` The name of the schema
``-q, --cql``            CQL filter to select features to delete
======================== =========================================================

.. _cli_ingest:

``ingest``
----------

The ingest command takes files in various formats and ingests them as ``SimpleFeature``\ s in GeoMesa.
Generally, a GeoMesa 'converter' definition is required to map input data to  ``SimpleFeature``\ s. GeoMesa
supports common input formats such as delimited text (TSV, CSV), fixed width files, JSON, XML, and Avro.
The converter framework is extensible via Java SPI, to allow support for custom formats. See
:ref:`converters` for more information on converters.

See :ref:`data_migration` for details on how the export/import commands can be used to move data between clusters.

====================== =========================================================
Argument               Description
====================== =========================================================
``-c, --catalog *``    The catalog table containing schema metadata
``-C, --converter``    The GeoMesa converter used to create ``SimpleFeature``\ s
``-s, --spec``         The ``SimpleFeatureType`` specification to create
``-f, --feature-name`` The name of the schema
``-t, --threads``      Number of parallel threads used
``--input-format``     Format of input files (csv, tsv, avro, shp, json, etc)
``--run-mode``         Must be one of ``distributed`` or ``local``
``--force``            Suppress any confirmation prompts
``<files>...``         Input files to ingest
====================== =========================================================

The ``--converter`` argument may be any of the following:

* The name of a GeoMesa converter already available on the classpath
* A converter configuration string
* The name of a file containing a converter configuration

If a converter is not specified, GeoMesa will attempt to infer a converter definition based on the input files.
Currently this supports GeoJSON, self-describing Avro, delimited text (TSV, CSV) or Shapefiles. If GeoMesa is able
to infer a schema and converter definition, the user can accept them as-is, or alternatively use them as the basis
for a fully custom converter. If desired, the user can persist the inferred converter to file, which allows for
easy modification and reuse. When ingesting a large data set, it can be useful to ingest a single file in local
mode, using schema inference to generate the converter. The converter definition can be persisted and tweaked to
satisfaction, then used for the entire data set with a distributed ingest.

See :ref:`cli_converter_conf` for more details on specifying the converter.

If the ``--feature-name`` is specified and the schema already exists, then ``--spec`` is not required. Likewise,
if a converter is not defined, the schema will be inferred alongside the converter. Otherwise, ``--spec`` may be
any of the following:

* A string of attributes, for example ``name:String,dtg:Date,*geom:Point:srid=4326``
* The name of a ``SimpleFeatureType`` already available on the classpath
* A string of attributes, defined as a TypeSafe configuration
* The name of a file containing one of the above

If the schema doesn't exist, the ``--feature-name`` argument is required if it is not implied by
the specification string. It may also be used to override the implied feature name.

See :ref:`cli_sft_conf` for more details on specifying the ``SimpleFeatureType``.

The ``--input-format`` argument can be used to specify the type of files being ingested. Currently
GeoMesa supports Avro, CSV, TSV, Json/GeoJson, GML, and SHP. If not specified, the input file extensions
will be used to determine the file type.

The ``--run-mode`` argument can be used to run ingestion locally or distributed (using map/reduce). Note that in
order to run in distributed mode, the input files must be in HDFS. By default, input files on the local filesystem
will be ingested in local mode, and input files in HDFS will be ingested in distributed mode.

The ``--threads`` argument can be used to increase local ingest speed. However, there can not be more threads
than there are input files. The ``--threads`` argument is ignored for distributed ingest.

The ``--force`` argument can be used to suppress any confirmation prompts (generally from converter inference),
which can be useful when scripting commands.

The ``<files>...`` argument specifies the files to be ingested. ``*`` may be used as a wild card in file paths.
GeoMesa can handle **gzip**, **bzip** and **xz** file compression as long as the file extensions match the
compression type. GeoMesa supports ingesting files from local disks or HDFS. In addition, Amazon's S3
and Microsoft's Azure file systems are supported with a few configuration changes. See
:doc:`/user/cli/filesystems` for details.

Instead of specifying files, input data may be piped directly to the ingest command using `stdin` shell redirection.
Note that this will only work in local mode, and will only use a single thread for ingestion. Schema inference is
disabled in this case, and progress indicators may not be entirely accurate, as the total size isn't known up front.
For example::

    cat foo.csv | geomesa-accumulo ingest ...
