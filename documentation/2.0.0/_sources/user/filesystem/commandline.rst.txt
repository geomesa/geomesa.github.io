FileSystem Command-Line Tools
=============================

The GeoMesa FileSystem distribution includes a set of command-line tools for feature
management, ingest, export and debugging.

To install the tools, see :ref:`setting_up_fsds_commandline`.

Once installed, the tools should be available through the command ``geomesa-fs``::

    $ geomesa-fs
    INFO  Usage: geomesa-fs [command] [command options]
      Commands:
        ...

Commands that are common to multiple back ends are described in :doc:`/user/cli/index`. The commands
here are FileSystem-specific.

General Arguments
-----------------

Most commands require you to specify the file system used. This generally includes the root path that the files
are under. Specify the path with ``--path`` (or ``-p``).

Commands
--------

``compact``
^^^^^^^^^^^

Compact one or more filesystem partitions.

======================== =========================================================
Argument                 Description
======================== =========================================================
``-f, --feature-name *`` The name of the schema
``--partitions``         Partitions to compact (omit to compact all partitions)
``--mode``               One of ``local`` or ``distributed`` (to use map/reduce)
``--temp-path``          Path to a temp directory used for working files
======================== =========================================================

The ``--temp-path`` argument may be useful when working with ``s3`` data, as ``s3`` is slow to write to.

``get-files``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Displays the files for one or more filesystem partitions.

======================== =========================================================
Argument                 Description
======================== =========================================================
``-f, --feature-name *`` The name of the schema
``--partitions``         Partitions to compact (omit to list all partitions)
======================== =========================================================

``get-partitions``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Displays the partitions for a given filesystem store.

======================== =============================================================
Argument                 Description
======================== =============================================================
``-f, --feature-name *`` The name of the schema
======================== =============================================================

.. _fsds_ingest_command:

``ingest``
^^^^^^^^^^

For an overview of ingestion options, see :ref:`cli_ingest`.

This command ingests files into a GeoMesa FS Datastore. Note that a "datastore" is simply a path in the filesystem.
All data and metadata will be stored in the filesystem under the hierarchy of the root path.

======================== =============================================================
Argument                 Description
======================== =============================================================
``-e, --encoding *``     The encoding used for the underlying files. Implementations are provided for ``parquet`` and ``orc``.
``--partition-scheme *`` Common partition scheme name (e.g. daily, z2) or path to a file containing a scheme config
``--num-reducers``       Number of reducers to use (required for distributed ingest)
``--leaf-storage``       Use leaf storage
``--temp-path``          Path to a temp directory used for working files
``--storage-opt``        Additional storage options, as ``key=value``
======================== =============================================================

The ``--partition-scheme`` argument should be the well-known name of a provided partition scheme, or the name
of a file containing a partition scheme. See :ref:`fsds_partition_schemes` for more information.

The ``--num-reducers`` should generally be set to half the number of partitions.

The ``--temp-path`` argument may be useful when working with ``s3`` data, as ``s3`` is slow to write to.

Example
~~~~~~~

Lets say that we have all our data for 2016 stored in an S3 bucket::

    $ geomesa-fs ingest \
       -p 's3a://mybucket/datastores/test' \
       -e parquet \
       --partition-scheme daily,z2-2bits \
       -s s3a://mybucket/schemas/my-config.conf \
       -C s3a://mybucket/schemas/my-config.conf \
       --temp-dir hdfs://namenode:port/tmp/gm/1 \
       --num-reducers 20 \
       's3a://mybucket/data/2016/*'

After ingest we expect to see a file structure with metadata and parquet files in S3 for our type named "myfeature"::

    aws s3 ls --recursive s3://mybucket/datastores/test

    datastores/test/myfeature/schema.sft
    datastores/test/myfeature/metadata
    datastores/test/myfeature/2016/01/01/0/0000.parquet
    datastores/test/myfeature/2016/01/01/2/0000.parquet
    datastores/test/myfeature/2016/01/01/3/0000.parquet
    datastores/test/myfeature/2016/01/02/0/0000.parquet
    datastores/test/myfeature/2016/01/02/1/0000.parquet
    datastores/test/myfeature/2016/01/02/3/0000.parquet

Two metadata files (``schema.sft`` and ``metadata``) store information about the schema, partition scheme, and list of
files that have been created. Note that the list of created files allows the datastore to quickly compute available
files to avoid possibly expensive directly listings against the filesystem. You may need to run ``update-metadata``
if you decide to insert new files.

Notice that the bucket "directory structure" includes year, month, day and then a 0,1,2,3 representing a quadrant of the
Z2 Space Filling Curve with 2bit resolution (i.e. 0 = lower left, 1 = lower right, 2 = upper left, 3 = upper right).
Note that in our example January 1st and 2nd both do not have all four quadrants represented. This means that the input
dataset for that day didn't have any data in that region of the world. If additional data were ingested, the directory
and a corresponding file would be created.

``update-metadata``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Recompute the list of partitions stored within the metadata file in a filesystem datastore. This metadata file
is used at query time in lieu of performing repeated directory listings.
